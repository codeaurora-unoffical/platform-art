Test various cases for full/partial-fragment deoptimization.

TODO: we should remove this test as its expectations at point of
writing was that debuggable apps could run un-deoptimizeable frames
from the boot image. Today, we deoptimize the boot image as soon as
we see the app being debuggable. Test 685-deoptimizeable is the proper
version of this test, but we currently keep the 602 version around to
try diagnosing a gcstress issue.
